        <h2>Sweetie pomelo</h2>
        <p>The Jaffa Swettie is an Israeli version of the American "Oroblanco" (Spanish for "white gold") grapefruit, created by crossing the Siamese Sweet Pomelo and the white "Marsh" grapefruit. In America, the new variety was developed at the University of California, Riverside, back in 1958, and sales began in 1980. In Israel, the "Jaffa Swettie" hit the market a little later, in 1984. The fruit resembles a grapefruit in shape and juiciness, but tastes like a sweet pomelo. This is apparently exactly what the breeders were aiming for. The rough skin is dark green at the beginning of the season and can gradually turn yellowish.</p>

        <h2>Pomelo Frutto Rose</h2>
        <p>The fruit is oval. The skin is thick, the segments are large, separated by a firm, dense membrane. The flesh is juicy and slightly tart (sweet and sour), with a bitter taste to the membranes (usually removed before eating). Each segment may contain seeds. The flesh is pink when fully ripe. </p>

        <h2>Pomelo Kao Pan</h2>
        <p>The Khao Pan pomelo is grown primarily in Thailand and is considered the most delicious of the Thai pomelo varieties. The fruits are large, spherical, compressed at the base and apex, and lemon-yellow in color. The flesh is straw-colored. The fruits are aromatic, juicy, and sweet, with a slight tartness. The membranes are slightly bitter (they are usually removed before eating).</p>

    <div class="pomelo-type">
        <h2>Pomelo Seravak</h2>
        <p>This variety is often called the "Tahitian grapefruit." Its origin is unknown, but it is believed to have been grown from seeds taken from Borneo (Sarawak State), then cultivated in Tahiti, and then introduced to Hawaii. It is a typical pomelo, but with a thin skin. The skin is greenish-yellow, and the flesh also has a greenish tint, but can acquire an amber tint when fully ripe. The fruits are juicy, with a sweet flavor that can resemble melon or lime. It is highly prized for its excellent taste and quality.</p>
